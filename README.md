This project focuses on the forensic analysis and privacy assessment of popular mobile applications, specifically Telegram and TikTok, using three key forensic tools: Andriller, MVT (Mobile Verification Toolkit), and ALEAPP (Android Logs, Events, and Protobuf Parser). Each tool serves a unique purpose in uncovering hidden or sensitive data within Android devices.
Andriller is employed to extract user data from Telegram, including messages, call logs, and cached media files. This helps reveal how user communication data is stored and the extent of recoverable information. MVT is used to detect potential spyware traces or vulnerabilities, offering insights into possible security threats linked to Telegram usage and how effectively the app protects user privacy. ALEAPP, on the other hand, parses Android logs and artifacts to analyze data from TikTok, such as user activities, timestamps, cached videos, and interactions. This provides a comprehensive look into what user information TikTok retains and exposes at the device level.
